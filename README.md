# Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android Developer Guide

## Introduction

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is a simple to use high level API, providing a collection of classes and functions for scanning and parsing 1D and 2D barcodes from your mobile deviceâ€™s camera or other image sources like your photo library.

Integrate our **Ready-To-Use UI** (RTU UI) with only a few lines of code. Benefit from a proven user experience, super fast integration time and customizable colors and texts to match your brand. Or dive into our **Classical UI Components** and build your fully customized scanning experience.


## Requirements

### Operating System
- Android 4.1 (API Level 16) and higher

### Hardware
- Rear-facing camera with autofocus
- Supported [CPUs and Architectures (ABIs)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/arch.html): `armeabi-v7`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86`, `x86_64`

### No Internet Connection Required
**The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.** It doesn't even contain any networking code.
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy.
All data generated by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is only stored on the end users device and in absolutely no case ever transferred to a server / cloud service controlled by us.
You as the customer will need to take care of uploading the scans / data to your backend, if desired.
