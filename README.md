Integrate our **Ready-To-Use UI** (RTU UI) with only a few lines of code. Benefit from a proven user experience, super fast integration time and customizable colors and texts to match your brand. Or dive into our **Classical UI Components** and build your fully customized scanning experience.


## Requirements

### No Internet Connection Required
**The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.** It doesn't even contain any networking code.
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy.
